# 🚀 Devspire – Where Coders Connect, Collaborate & Create

Devspire is a full-stack social collaboration platform designed **for developers and tech enthusiasts** to share knowledge, solve bugs, stream live coding sessions, and grow together as a community. Think of it as the **go-to hub for coders**, with features tailored for students, professionals, and open-source contributors.

> 🌱 This project is currently in active development. Some advanced features (like video streaming and AI integration) are planned and coming soon!
